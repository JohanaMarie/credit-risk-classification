Credit Risk Analysis Report
Purpose: 
    To utilize past lending data in a logistic regression model to determine credit risk for lenders.

Model accuracy:
    All predictions for the 0 (healthy loan) category were accurate. However, performance for the 1 (high-risk loan) category was slightly lower compared to the "0" category. The model's accuracy for each category is as follows:
        Precision: 86% accurate
        Recall: 91% accurate
        F1-score: 88% accurate

Results:
    The logistic regression model achieved 100% accuracy in predicting healthy loans, demonstrating its reliability in identifying low-risk borrowers. However, it achieved a lower accuracy rate of 86% in predicting high-risk loans. Despite this, the model's overall performance remains beneficial to lenders in mitigating the risk of bad loans, as evidenced by its strong precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
